# hirst-painting-generator
This is a simple hirst-painting generator that takes an input image, extracts its color palette, and generates a Hirst-inspired painting using those colors. Inspired by the iconic spot paintings of Damien Hirst, this script recreates the artistic effect by using circles filled with the sampled colors from the input image.
